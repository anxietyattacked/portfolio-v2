      <p className="md:text-lg">
        I graduated from Oregon State University with a Bachelors of Science in
        Economics. After college I started learning Python for data analysis.
        After learning the basics of programing, I wanted to learn the data
        visualization library d3.js and web development in general. So I learned
        JavaScript, React, CSS, HTML and started building projects. I have also
        continued learning about data analysis and data science as well. For
        data analysis I frequently use Python, R, SQL, Tableau, Excel, Pandas,
        Tidyverse, and Plotly. For web development I frequently JavaScript
        TypeScript, React, CSS, HTML, Node, GraphQL, and D3.js.
